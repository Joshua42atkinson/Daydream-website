E-Portfolio Content Development for LDT CompetenciesPart 1: A Framework for LDT Competency PortfoliosA. Deconstructing the Portfolio's PurposeThis report provides a comprehensive analysis of the Learning Design and Technology (LDT) competency portfolio requirements and delivers drafted content for three key technology badges: 'Basic Tools,' 'Research Tools,' and 'Presentation Tools.' The portfolio submission deadline is November 17, 2025, for the &quot;Portfolio Gate Review,&quot; which requires a total of 12 completed challenges.Analysis of the provided student portfolio examples 2 was not possible as the links were inaccessible. However, a deep analysis of the official program documentation—including the LDT Competency tracking sheets 1 and the Technology Badge Repository documents 1—provides a more authoritative and effective foundation for structuring the portfolio content.The most critical structural element of the LDT portfolio is the relationship between the four LDT Academic Competency &quot;Supra-Badges&quot; and the 13 &quot;Technology Badges.&quot; These are not two separate, parallel requirements; they are fundamentally interconnected.The LDT Technology Badges (e.g., 'Basic Tools,' 'Video Production') serve as primary artifacts to demonstrate competency within the academic &quot;Supra-Badge&quot; framework. This connection is explicitly defined within the PROFESSIONAL FOUNDATIONS IN LDT (Supra-Badge).1The logical chain is as follows:The &quot;PROFESSIONAL FOUNDATIONS IN LDT&quot; Supra-Badge requires completing a challenge under the &quot;ID KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, AND ATTITUDES&quot; sub-badge.1This sub-badge provides an option to: &quot;Acquire and apply new technology skills in instructional design practice&quot;.1The official examples provided for this specific challenge are the &quot;LDT Technology Badges&quot;.1The reflection criteria are explicit and non-negotiable: The &quot;Reflection must address: How you acquired your new skills (webinar, training, etc.) and how you have applied these new abilities in your own instructional design practice&quot;.1Therefore, every &quot;challenge content&quot; entry for a technology badge must be a detailed, reflective narrative. It is insufficient to merely state what was created (e.g., &quot;A blog was made&quot;). To meet the competency, the reflection must articulate the process of skill acquisition and, most importantly, the application of that new technological skill to the professional practice of instructional design.B. The Anatomy of a High-Scoring Badge PageBased on this analysis, each technology badge page within the portfolio website should follow a consistent structure to ensure clarity and demonstrate alignment with the LDT competencies.Proposed Page Structure:Page Title: (e.g., Basic Tools)Badge Image: The official Purdue badge image (e.g., Image 3: BASIC COURSE TOOLS).Purpose: A 1-2 sentence statement of the badge's purpose, taken directly from the Technology Badge Repository summary.1Competency Connection: A brief, explicit statement linking the badge to the LDT Supra-Badge.Template: &quot;This badge serves as a primary artifact for the PROFESSIONAL FOUNDATIONS IN LDT Supra-Badge. The challenges below demonstrate competency in 'Acquiring and applying new technology skills in instructional design practice,' as defined by the LDT program criteria.1&quot;Challenge-by-Challenge Breakdown: The page must be divided into sections for each required challenge (e.g., &quot;Challenge 1: Reflective Writing&quot;). Each section must include two components:Artifact: A brief (1-2 sentence) description of the deliverable, followed by the embedded artifact or a direct link to it.Reflection: A detailed (300-500 word) reflective narrative. This text must be structured to meet the competency criteria: addressing how the skill was acquired and how the skill is applied to instructional design practice.1The following sections provide the drafted content for 10 challenges across the 'Basic Tools,' 'Research Tools,' and 'Presentation Tools' badges, written to satisfy these specific program requirements.Part 2: Drafting 'Basic Tools' Badge ContentPage Title: Basic ToolsBadge Image:Purpose: &quot;This badge focuses on demonstrating skills and competence with various digital tools that are often found effective and needed in one's daily life. These are tools that will allow you to showcase your work, reflectively review and discuss your work, and provide means to store your work&quot;.1Competency Connection: This badge serves as a primary artifact for the PROFESSIONAL FOUNDATIONS IN LDT Supra-Badge. The challenges below demonstrate competency in &quot;Acquiring and applying new technology skills in instructional design practice,&quot; as defined by the LDT program criteria.1Requirements SummaryChallengeWhat Students Will DemonstrateRequired Artifact/DeliverableChallenge 1Use of blogs as writing toolsA link to a published blog post (2-3 paragraphs) with 1-2 clickable external links.Challenge 2Use of screencast tools to create videos of the computer screen with voice narration.A link to a 60-120 second screencast video with good quality audio/video.Challenge 3Use of cloud storage and sharing tools to store and share information.A link to a screencast video demonstrating cloud storage folder structure and sharing process.Challenge 1: Reflective Writing (Blog)Drafted Artifact Description:This artifact is a blog post created in.1 The post, titled &quot;,&quot; discusses and includes embedded links to relevant external resources, fulfilling the challenge criteria for a well-written post with clickable hyperlinks.1Drafted Reflection Content:The skill of reflective writing using a blog platform was acquired through a review of the tool's interface and the &quot;How to Use Blogger&quot; tutorials.1 The process involved setting up the blog, formatting the initial post, and correctly embedding external hyperlinks, as required by the challenge. This technical acquisition, however, is merely the foundation. The true competency is in understanding the application of this tool within a professional context.In instructional design practice, the blog platform is a versatile tool for professional communication and instructional delivery. Its first application is as a tool for &quot;reflective practice,&quot; a foundational element of professional growth. As an ID professional, maintaining a blog can serve as a &quot;dev blog&quot; for complex projects, allowing the instructional designer to document design decisions, trace the evolution of a project, and share challenges and solutions with a professional learning network (PLN).Second, this tool directly applies to the LDT competency &quot;Deliver presentations that effectively engage audiences and communicate clear messages&quot;.1 A blog post is, in effect, a static, written presentation. Within an instructional module (e.g., in Brightspace), a blog can be used as an instructional tool to introduce new topics, pose reflective questions, or provide supplementary materials that &quot;effectively engage audiences&quot; in an asynchronous format. This demonstrates the ability to &quot;write and edit messages that are clear, concise, and grammatically correct&quot; 1 in a public-facing, instructional context.Finally, a blog is a powerful tool for stakeholder management. During the development of a large-scale project, a private blog can be used to keep stakeholders informed of progress, showcase prototype screenshots, and explain the rationale behind design choices. This creates a transparent record of the project's lifecycle and serves as a method for &quot;soliciting, accepting, and providing constructive feedback&quot; 1 from the project team and SMEs in a single, centralized location.Challenge 2: Screencast ToolDrafted Artifact Description:This artifact is a-second screencast video created using.1 It provides a brief tutorial on. The video demonstrates clear audio narration and high-quality screen capture, meeting the challenge criteria.1Drafted Reflection Content:Proficiency in screencasting was acquired by completing the &quot;Basic Tools Challenge 2&quot; requirements.1 This involved selecting a tool (Screencastify), reviewing tutorials on its use, developing a short script, and then recording and publishing the final video. The process required several takes to ensure the narration was clear and the mouse movements were smooth, fulfilling the criteria for a &quot;personally produced 60-120 second screencast&quot;.1This skill is not merely an add-on but is an essential, everyday tool for a modern instructional designer. Its primary application in my ID practice is the rapid development of micro-learning and performance support tools. When a &quot;gap analysis&quot; 1 reveals that a performance problem is caused by a simple knowledge gap (e.g., &quot;how do I use this new software feature?&quot;), a full e-learning module is inefficient. A two-minute screencast is the perfect non-instructional or &quot;performance support&quot; intervention. It is fast to produce, easy to update, and provides &quot;just-in-time&quot; support for the learner at their moment of need.Furthermore, this skill is critical to the process of instructional design, particularly in managing SME and stakeholder relationships. Instead of sending a static, 50-page storyboard PDF for review, a screencast can be used to create a 5-minute &quot;walk-through&quot; of a prototype. This allows the designer to guide the reviewer's attention, explain design choices, and ask for specific feedback. This practice directly supports the competency &quot;Solicit, accept, and provide constructive feedback&quot;.1 It respects the SME's time, provides clearer context than an email, and creates a clear, asynchronous record of what was presented for review, streamlining the entire development cycle.Challenge 3: Cloud Storage and SharingDrafted Artifact Description:This artifact is a screencast video demonstrating the cloud storage and sharing process using.1 The video fulfills the challenge criteria by explaining the folder structure, demonstrating how a new document is created and saved, and showing the process for sharing a file or folder with a collaborator.1Drafted Reflection Content:This skill was acquired by completing &quot;Basic Tools Challenge 3&quot;.1 This involved organizing a account into a logical folder structure for a typical ID project and then recording a screencast to explain that system and demonstrate its use.In instructional design practice, cloud storage is the central hub for project management, collaboration, and version control. Its application goes far beyond simple storage. First, it is the primary tool for managing version control. An ID project involves numerous assets (design documents, storyboards, graphic assets, SME feedback documents). A shared cloud drive ensures a &quot;single source of truth&quot; for the entire project team, preventing the confusion that arises from multiple, conflicting versions of a file saved on local drives.Second, this tool is the engine of collaboration, especially with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). By sharing a design document or storyboard via, the SME can add comments and suggestions directly into the file. This creates an immediate, asynchronous feedback loop and directly supports the competency &quot;Solicit, accept, and provide constructive feedback&quot;.1Finally, this tool is essential for &quot;complying with organizational constraints&quot;.1 In any professional setting, instructional designers must work within the organization's approved technology ecosystem. This often includes specific cloud storage platforms (e.g., OneDrive, Box, Google Workspace). Demonstrating proficiency in these tools shows an ability to adapt to an organization's internal processes, manage project assets securely, and respect constraints related to data privacy and file sharing. It is a foundational skill for all other collaborative ID work.Part 3: Drafting 'Research Tools' Badge ContentPage Title: Research ToolsBadge Image:Purpose: &quot;This badge focuses on several types of tools that facilitate gathering, organizing, and reporting information. We are bombarded with information each day, these tools can be used to help you strategically brainstorm, select, prioritize, organize, map, highlight, store and later retrieve and report information in some predetermined manner that is useful&quot;.1Competency Connection: This badge serves as a primary artifact for the PROFESSIONAL FOUNDATIONS IN LDT Supra-Badge. The challenges below demonstrate competency in &quot;Acquiring and applying new technology skills in instructional design practice,&quot; as defined by the LDT program criteria.1Requirements SummaryChallengeWhat Students Will DemonstrateAssociated TechnologiesRecommended ArtifactChallenge 1Use of notetaking toolsEvernote, OneNote, Zoho Notebook3-5 screenshots of an organized digital notebook (e.g., a OneNote notebook) showing sections, pages, and tagged notes for a research project.Challenge 2Use of social bookmarking toolsWakelet, Diigo, Pinterest, PocketA public link to a curated collection (e.g., a Wakelet) containing at least 10-15 relevant, annotated resources on a specific topic.Challenge 3Use of mindmapping &amp; brainstorming toolsMindmeister, Popplet, PadletAn embedded mind map (e.g., from Mindmeister) or a link to a collaborative Padlet board demonstrating the visual organization of ideas.Challenge 1: Notetaking ToolsDrafted Artifact Description:This artifact consists of [Number] screenshots from a notebook 1 used for. The images demonstrate the notebook's organizational structure, including sections for different research themes, pages for individual article summaries, and the use of tags for cross-referencing.Drafted Reflection Content:Skill with digital notetaking tools was acquired through practical application in LDT coursework. While tools like OneNote were familiar, their systematic application to academic research and ID projects was a new skill. This involved creating a structured notebook, using tags to categorize concepts, and embedding PDFs and web clippings for analysis.The application of this skill is central to the PLANNING AND ANALYSIS (Supra-Badge).1 A digital notebook is the professional repository for all &quot;Front-End Analysis&quot; data. During the analysis phase, an instructional designer gathers large amounts of qualitative data from SME interviews, stakeholder meetings, learner focus groups, and observations. A tool like OneNote is where this raw data is captured, organized, and synthesized. Notes from an SME interview can be tagged with themes (e.g., &quot;performance gap,&quot; &quot;motivation issue,&quot; &quot;tech constraint&quot;). This tagging system is invaluable for later synthesizing the data and &quot;conducting a gap analysis&quot; 1 to determine the root cause of the performance problem.This tool is also the primary workspace for completing the &quot;Use appropriate techniques to analyze various types and sources to validate content&quot; challenge.1 When conducting a literature review to support a design choice, a digital notebook allows the designer to clip articles, annotate PDFs directly, summarize key findings, and cross-reference authors. This creates a traceable, auditable trail of research that validates the instructional strategies and content proposed in the final design.Challenge 2: Social Bookmarking ToolsDrafted Artifact Description:This artifact is a public link to a collection 1 titled &quot;.&quot; This collection curates [Number] high-quality articles, videos, and web resources on this topic, with each entry including a short annotation explaining its relevance.Drafted Reflection Content:The acquisition of this skill involved exploring and comparing several social bookmarking platforms, including Pocket, Pinterest, and Wakelet.1 Wakelet was selected for its ability to organize diverse media types (articles, videos, tweets) into a single, cohesive collection and to add annotations, which is key for instructional use.The primary application of this skill is in &quot;Personal Knowledge Management&quot; (PKM) and professional development. The field of LDT changes rapidly. This tool directly supports the competency &quot;Participate in professional development activities&quot; 1 by providing a system to capture, organize, and retrieve emerging ideas, case studies, and new technology reviews. This ensures that instructional design practice is informed by the most current research and trends.The second, more direct application is curation as an instructional product. Not all learning problems require a formal &quot;course.&quot; Often, learners simply need access to good, well-organized resources. A curated Wakelet or Pocket collection can be a perfect &quot;performance support&quot; tool or &quot;informal learning&quot; resource. This collection can be linked within a formal course or provided as a standalone resource hub, allowing learners to explore a topic at their own pace.Finally, this tool is highly effective during the &quot;Analysis&quot; phase of ADDIE. When conducting an &quot;environmental scan&quot; or &quot;content analysis&quot; 1 to identify existing instructional materials, a social bookmarking tool is used to collect and annotate potential resources. This prevents redundant work and supports the &quot;SELECT OR MODIFY EXISTING INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS&quot; competency 1 by creating a repository of pre-existing materials that can be integrated into a new design.Challenge 3: Mindmapping &amp; Brainstorming ToolsDrafted Artifact Description:This artifact is an embedded mind map created in.1 It visually deconstructs the learning goals for, breaking them down into terminal objectives, subordinate skills, and prerequisite knowledge.Drafted Reflection Content:Proficiency in mindmapping was developed through its application in LDT projects. While the concept was familiar, its rigorous use as an analytical tool was a new skill acquired through practice. This involved using [Mindmeister] to move beyond simple brainstorming and into systematic instructional analysis.This skill is one of the most powerful and direct applications of technology to the PLANNING AND ANALYSIS (Supra-Badge).1 A mind map is the single best tool for conducting a &quot;goal analysis&quot; and &quot;task analysis.&quot; It provides a visual method to &quot;determine subordinate and prerequisite skills and knowledge&quot;.1 By starting with the terminal objective, a mind map allows the designer to branch out, asking &quot;What must the learner know or do before they can achieve this?&quot; This process is repeated until all prerequisite skills and entry-level knowledge are identified. This visual map ensures no critical steps are missed in the instructional plan.This analysis flows directly into the DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT (Supra-Badge).1 The hierarchical structure of the completed mind map serves as the blueprint to &quot;Identify and sequence instructional goals&quot;.1 The visual flow of the map (from the outside branches in) often dictates the logical and most effective sequence for instruction, ensuring that foundational knowledge is built before more complex skills are introduced.Furthermore, collaborative tools like [Padlet]1 can be used during initial brainstorming to &quot;solicit... feedback&quot; 1 from learners or SMEs. This ensures the analysis is grounded in the learners' real-world needs and captures expert knowledge accurately from the very beginning of the project.Part 4: Drafting 'Presentation Tools' Badge ContentPage Title: Presentation ToolsBadge Image:Purpose: &quot;Presentation tools are those technologies that facilitate the development and delivery of information and content to the audience/learners... To obtain this badge, you will demonstrate how to use tools to create standard presentations, adapted presentations that involve animations, and additional resources for your presentation in the form of infographics&quot;.1Competency Connection: This badge serves as a primary artifact for the PROFESSIONAL FOUNDATIONS IN LDT Supra-Badge. The challenges below demonstrate competency in &quot;Acquiring and applying new technology skills in instructional design practice,&quot; as defined by the LDT program criteria.1Requirements SummaryChallengeWhat Students Will DemonstrateAssociated TechnologiesRecommended ArtifactChallenge 1How to design... using storyboards/design documents(None listed)A 2-3 page PDF of a storyboard (e.g., for a video or e-learning module) showing visual, text, and narration elements.Challenge 2How to use tools to develop a simple presentationPowerPoint, Prezi, Keynote, Google SlidesAn embedded Google Slides or PowerPoint presentation (10-15 slides) on an instructional topic.Challenge 3How to use tools to adapt a presentationVideoScribe, Vyond, Powtoons, AnimakerAn embedded 1-2 minute animated video (e.g., from Vyond) explaining a concept or process.Challenge 4How to add resources... (e.g., infographics)Canva, Piktochart, Easel.ly, VenngageAn embedded infographic (e.g., from Canva) that visually summarizes a process or set of data.Challenge 1: Presentation Design (Storyboards/Design Documents)Drafted Artifact Description:This artifact is a [Number]-page PDF storyboard for a short animated video titled &quot;.&quot; It was created as the blueprint for the artifact in Challenge 3. It outlines each scene, the on-screen text, the corresponding voice-over narration, visual descriptions, and any developer notes.Drafted Reflection Content:The professional skill of storyboarding was acquired and refined through LDT coursework, particularly in. This process involved translating a set of learning objectives from an analysis document into a visual, sequential plan for development. This artifact represents the most critical component of the &quot;DESIGN&quot; phase of the ADDIE model.The application of this skill is central to the DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT (Supra-Badge).1 A storyboard is not just a plan; it is the deliverable that translates abstract analysis into a concrete product. The storyboarding process is precisely where the instructional designer must &quot;Identify instructional strategies that align with instructional goals and anticipated learning outcomes&quot;.1 For every scene, a deliberate choice is made: &quot;Does this learning objective require a text summary, a character scenario, a visual diagram, or an interactive question?&quot; This document is the evidence of that alignment.Furthermore, the storyboard is a critical project management and communication tool. It is the primary document used to &quot;solicit, accept, and provide constructive feedback&quot; 1 from Subject Matter Experts (SMEs). Gaining SME sign-off on the storyboard before development (e.g., video production, e-learning authoring) begins is the single most effective way to &quot;comply with organizational constraints&quot; 1 like time, budget, and scope. It prevents costly re-work and ensures all stakeholders are aligned on the final product, a process that is fundamental to professional instructional design practice.Challenge 2: Simple Presentation Development (e.g., Google Slides)Drafted Artifact Description:This artifact is a [Number]-slide Google Slides presentation 1 titled &quot;.&quot; It provides an instructional overview of. The design is intentionally clear, concise, and visually organized to serve as an effective learning resource.Drafted Reflection Content:Proficiency in presentation software like Google Slides or PowerPoint 1 was acquired over many years, but its application to instruction (rather than simple presentation) was a skill honed in the LDT program. This challenge involved moving beyond text-heavy bullet points and applying principles of visual design and cognitive load theory.The application of this skill directly supports two LDT competencies. First, it demonstrates the ability to &quot;Deliver presentations that effectively engage audiences and communicate clear messages&quot;.1 This goes beyond public speaking and applies to the design of asynchronous presentations. By using strong visuals, limited text, and a clear narrative structure, the presentation is designed to &quot;effectively engage&quot; the learner.Second, this artifact is a direct response to the &quot;DESIGN INSTRUCTIONAL INTERVENTIONS&quot; challenge to &quot;Use appropriate message and visual design principles&quot;.1 The design choices reflect key visual design principles: Contrast (e.g., dark text on a light background for readability), Repetition (e.g., consistent fonts and color palette), Alignment (e.g., intentional placement of text and images), and Proximity (e.g., grouping related items). These principles are not merely aesthetic; they are cognitive. They reduce extraneous cognitive load by making the information easier to process, allowing the learner to dedicate their mental resources to understanding the content, which is the core of effective instructional message design.Challenge 3: Adapted/Animated Presentation (e.g., Vyond)Drafted Artifact Description:This artifact is a-second animated &quot;explainer&quot; video created in.1 It explains the using animated characters, on-screen text, and voice-over narration. This artifact was built based on the storyboard from Challenge 1.Drafted Reflection Content:Skills in animated presentation tools were acquired through self-directed learning, including online tutorials and experimentation with the [Vyond] platform. The process involved writing a script, selecting characters and scenes, synchronizing animations to the voice-over, and exporting the final video.This skill is a key component of the DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT (Supra-Badge) 1, specifically for the challenge to &quot;Apply appropriate motivational design principles&quot;.1 Animation tools like Vyond are uniquely suited to applying John Keller's ARCS Model of Motivation:Attention: Animation and character scenarios are far more effective at gaining and holding learner Attention than static text.Relevance: By using character scenarios that mirror the learner's work environment, the instruction demonstrates clear Relevance to their job.Confidence: Animation can break down complex, abstract processes (like a system flow or a theoretical model) into simple, visible steps, which builds learner Confidence.Satisfaction: The engaging and often entertaining nature of the medium leads to greater learner Satisfaction.This tool is also a powerful instructional strategy for &quot;Develop[ing] materials that align with the content analyses&quot;.1 When an analysis determines that learners are struggling with a complex or &quot;dry&quot; topic, animation is a strategic choice to increase engagement and improve knowledge transfer by making the abstract concrete and the complex simple.Challenge 4: Resource Creation (Infographics, e.g., Canva)Drafted Artifact Description:This artifact is an infographic created in1 that summarizes. It uses a combination of icons, color, and concise text to present key information in a format that is easily scannable and visually appealing.Drafted Reflection Content:Proficiency in graphic design tools like Canva was acquired through the LDT program as a means to create visually compelling, professional-grade instructional materials. This involved learning to select templates, apply visual design principles (like proximity and alignment), and edit content to be extremely concise.The most direct application of this skill is the creation of &quot;job aids&quot; and &quot;performance support tools.&quot; An infographic is a perfect example of a &quot;non-instructional intervention&quot;.1 It does not teach a new, complex skill from scratch, but it supports performance at the moment of need. For example, an infographic summarizing the steps of a process can be posted in a workspace or linked in a resource hub. This directly addresses performance improvement needs identified in the &quot;gap analysis&quot;.1Beyond job aids, this skill has a high-level application in the EVALUATION AND IMPLEMENTATION (Supra-Badge).1 A critical part of an instructional designer's job is communicating results to stakeholders. An infographic is the ideal format to &quot;Create a plan for the dissemination and/or the diffusion of the interventions&quot;.1 Complex &quot;summative evaluation&quot; data (e.g., from Kirkpatrick's Four Levels) 1 can be translated into a clear, concise, and visually compelling infographic. This allows the designer to &quot;communicate a clear message&quot; 1 to leadership, demonstrating the project's impact and return on investment (ROI) in a format that is quickly understood and highly effective.Part 5: Final Review &amp; Submission StrategyA. Summary Reflection for the &quot;Professional Foundations&quot; PageThe following text block is a drafted summary. It is recommended that this text be placed on the main portfolio page for the PROFESSIONAL FOUNDATIONS IN LDT (Supra-Badge). It serves to synthesize the technology-focused activities and explicitly connect them to the program's core competencies.Drafted Summary Reflection:The artifacts presented in this section, specifically the LDT Technology Badges, serve as evidence for the &quot;Acquire and apply new technology skills in instructional design practice&quot; competency.1 The completion of the 'Basic Tools,' 'Research Tools,' and 'Presentation Tools' badges represents more than technical proficiency; it demonstrates a systematic integration of these technologies into a professional instructional design workflow.As the individual reflections for each badge demonstrate, these skills are applied across the entire ADDIE model. Technologies are used to:Analyze: Conduct goal and task analyses (e.g., Mindmeister) and synthesize front-end analysis data (e.g., OneNote).1Design: Apply motivational design principles (e.g., Vyond) and visual design principles (e.g., Google Slides), and create the core instructional blueprint (e.g., Storyboards).1Develop: Create performance support job aids (e.g., Canva) and micro-learning videos (e.g., Screencastify).1Implement &amp; Evaluate: Manage project assets and stakeholder feedback (e.g., Google Drive) and create materials to disseminate evaluation results (e.g., Canva).1This collection of skills represents a commitment to lifelong learning and the professional competency of selecting and applying the appropriate technology to solve specific learning and performance problems.B.
