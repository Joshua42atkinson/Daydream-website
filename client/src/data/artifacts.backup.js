Using <strong class='text-white'>Bloom's Taxonomy</strong> as a guide, I sequenced these goals from lower-order thinking skills (Observation/Recall) to higher-order skills (Analysis/Synthesis).

This sequencing ensures that the learner possesses the prerequisite knowledge before attempting the terminal performance.</p><p class='mb-4'>I operationalized this sequence through the <span class='text-yellow-300 font-medium'>'Quest Engine'</span> architecture. Instead of a linear syllabus, I engineered a 'Dependency Graph' where instructional goals are represented as 'Quest Steps' (e.g., <code>STEP_02_IDENTIFY_PARTS</code>). The code strictly enforces this sequence; the 'Repair' interaction is mechanically locked until the 'Analyze' flag is set to true.

Skill with digital notetaking tools was acquired through practical application in LDT coursework.

During the analysis phase, an instructional designer gathers large amounts of qualitative data from SME interviews, stakeholder meetings, learner focus groups, and observations. A tool like OneNote is where this raw data is captured, organized, and synthesized. Notes from an SME interview can be tagged with themes (e.g., \"performance gap,\" \"motivation issue,\" \"tech constraint\"). This tagging system is invaluable for later synthesizing the data and \"conducting a gap analysis\" 1 to determine the root cause of the performance problem.</p><p class='mb-4'>This tool is also the primary workspace for completing the \"Use appropriate techniques to analyze various types and sources to validate content\" challenge.1 When conducting a literature review to support a design choice, a digital notebook allows the designer to clip articles, annotate PDFs directly, summarize key findings, and cross-reference authors.
