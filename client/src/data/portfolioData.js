Rather than defending the sheer volume of my original documentation, I entered the dialogue with a 'learner's mindset.' The process involved analyzing his specific critique: that the proposal was 'trying to be everything at once.' In direct response, I created a new Executive Summary that stripped away the 'Daydream' sprawl and defined a clear 'Phase 1: Performance Psychology Sandbox.' This revision directly addressed his critique by simplifying the pitch and clarifying the specific ask.",

Moving forward, I will prioritize creating Executive Summaries to identify the MVP, ensuring I build what the organization can actually support."
