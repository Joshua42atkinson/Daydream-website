In this artifact, Intrinsic Load is modeled as 'Cargo Weight,' Extraneous Load as 'Track Friction,' and Germane Load as 'Combustion.' By mapping Sweller's CLT to a railway physics simulation, I demonstrated that instructional design theories are not just guidelines but are governed by immutable laws similar to thermodynamics.

In firefighting, we operate under strict physical laws: pump pressure must match hose resistance, or the system fails. I applied this same 'systems thinking' to Cognitive Load Theory, treating the learner's mind not as a black box, but as a mechanical system with finite limits. My ability to 'vibe code' this platform from scratch—leveraging AI to execute complex logic without prior programming experience—demonstrates my core competency: meta-cognition. I translated my understanding of the 'Self' (cultivated through meditation) and operational logistics into a digital pedagogy, proving that the principles of managing pressure and flow are universal, whether in a fire hose or a human mind."

I aligned the 'Gradient' of the virtual track with Bloom's levels: Remembering is a 'Flat Track' (DC 5), while Creating is a 'Vertical Rack' (DC 30). This allows the system to measure the learner's cognitive process in real-time.

I analyzed the target population and identified four distinct learner profiles (e.g., The Sage, who values accuracy; The Hero, who values speed). I then designed specific 'Locomotive Stats' (Traction, Efficiency) to match these profiles.
