The true competency is in understanding the application of this tool within a professional context.\nIn instructional design practice, the blog platform is a versatile tool for professional communication and instructional delivery. Its first application is as a tool for \"reflective practice,\" a foundational element of professional growth. As an ID professional, maintaining a blog can serve as a \"dev blog\" for complex projects, allowing the instructional designer to document design decisions, trace the evolution of a project, and share challenges and solutions with a professional learning network (PLN).\nSecond, this tool directly applies to the LDT competency \"Deliver presentations that effectively engage audiences and communicate clear messages\".1 A blog post is, in effect, a static, written presentation. Within an instructional module (e.g., in Brightspace), a blog can be used as an instructional tool to introduce new topics, pose reflective questions, or provide supplementary materials that \"effectively engage audiences\" in an asynchronous format. This demonstrates the ability to \"write and edit messages that are clear, concise, and grammatically correct\" 1 in a public-facing, instructional context.\nFinally, a blog is a powerful tool for stakeholder management. During the development of a large-scale project, a private blog can be used to keep stakeholders informed of progress, showcase prototype screenshots, and explain the rationale behind design choices.

Detailed Presentation Outline\nThe following table details the key instructional elements, sub-elements, and sequencing for the 6-minute presentation 2:\nPart II: Presentation Tools - Challenge 2: The Core Presentation & Screencast\n2.1. Recommended Tool & Feature Integration\nTool: Google Slides.2\nJustification: Google Slides is a web-based presentation tool, aligning perfectly with the ethos of the Ask Pete project (a web app) and the LDT program's focus on accessible, shareable, and collaborative technologies.2\nRequired Feature Integration (Meeting 2-3 Affordances) 2:\n\"Share\" Feature (Real-time Collaboration): The primary link submitted for this badge challenge will be a demonstration of this key affordance. The presentation is instantly accessible and reviewable from any location.\nEmbedded Multimedia & Graphics: The presentation will \"incorporate visual pictures, graphics,\" etc., by embedding key visual concepts from the project. Specifically, Slide 3 will feature a visual mockup of the \"Open Book\" UI 3, and a later slide (or an appendix) could embed the infographic developed for Challenge 4.2\nSpeaker Notes: The \"Speaker Notes\" feature will be used to house the full, synchronized narration script (provided in section 2.3) for the screencast recording. This demonstrates a key affordance for professional presentation delivery and preparation.\n2.2. Visual Presentation Slide-by-Slide Blueprint\n2.3. Full Narration Script (Target Time: 5:40)\n(Slide 1: Title)\n(0:00) Hello. My name is, and this is the instructional blueprint for the Ask Pete Initiative, a project I am framing as a \"Performance Psychology Sandbox.\" This presentation will demonstrate how this project meets key instructional goals for the LDT Technology Badge.2\n(Slide 2: The Edutainment Gap)\n(0:15) The core problem this project addresses is what I call the \"Edutainment Gap\".1 Right now, the educational technology market is largely polarized. On one side, you have AI-driven entertainment platforms like AI Dungeon. These offer limitless, unscripted, and captivating narratives that adolescents love, but they possess zero pedagogical structure. They are purely recreational.1\n(0:40) On the other side, you have gamified educational applications like Duolingo or Quizlet. These are highly effective at teaching discrete facts, like vocabulary, through structured lessons and spaced repetition. But their narrative elements are superficial—just a thin veneer over repetitive drills, failing to foster deep emotional engagement.1\n(0:57) Ask Pete is strategically designed to fill this gap.\n(Slide 3: The Hero's Journey)\n(0:58) The pedagogical backbone of Ask Pete is Joseph Campbell's monomyth: the \"Hero's Journey\".1 This universal narrative structure—a call to adventure, a series of trials, and a triumphant return with new knowledge—provides a powerful, natural scaffold for constructivist and situated learning theories.1\n(1:20) This represents a significant departure from decontextualized learning. For instance, instead of memorizing a word from a static flashcard, a Ask Pete user acquires and applies new vocabulary—specifically from the SAT and Academic Word List—to overcome tangible, narrative-driven challenges.1\n(1:40) As you can see in this mockup 3, a student doesn't just learn the word \"precarious.\" They must understand and apply the word \"precarious\" to successfully navigate a crumbling bridge and retrieve a quest artifact. This embeds the learning within a purposeful, goal-oriented process, transforming the student from a passive learner into the active protagonist of their own educational epic.1\n(Slide 4: Jungian Archetypes)\n(2:00) To deepen this psychological experience, the character creation system is also a pedagogical tool. It forgoes traditional RPG stats like 'strength' or 'intelligence'. Instead, Ask Pete employs Carl Jung's archetypes—The Hero, The Mentor, The Shadow, The Trickster.1\n(2:20) As seen in this mockup, a user builds their character by defining their personality along a scale for each archetype.1 This isn't just a novel game mechanic; it's a bridge to pedagogy. It provides the user with a rich vocabulary for understanding human motivation and behavior. This identity framework then becomes the foundation for the platform's core innovation.1\n(Slide 5: AI as a Mirror)\n(2:45) That core innovation is a feature I call \"AI as a Mirror\".1 This system is engineered to move beyond simple content delivery and foster deep, metacognitive reflection.\n(3:00) At the conclusion of major story arcs, the platform triggers a special \"Reflection Quest\".1 During these sequences, the AI's persona visibly shifts. It changes from a neutral \"Narrator\" that tells the story, into a Socratic \"Contemplative Guide\" that facilitates reflection.1\n(3:18) This Guide then prompts the user with personalized questions designed to encourage self-analysis of their in-game choices, connecting those decisions back to their real-world values and their chosen character archetypes.1\n(Slide 6: Psychological Safety)\n(3:33) For instance, the Guide might ask, \"Your character, who embodies the Caregiver archetype, chose to sacrifice the artifact to save the villager. How does that reflect your own values when faced with a choice between personal gain and helping others?\".1\n(3:50) Critically, this feature is engineered to create a space of high psychological safety.1 The one-on-one, private interaction with a non-human, non-judgmental AI guide creates an environment where students can be vulnerable. It allows them to explore their own motivations, ethical dilemmas, and mistakes without the fear of peer scrutiny that so often stifles authentic reflection in a group setting.1\n(Slide 7: Know, Feel, Do)\n(4:17) This entire experience is consciously designed to align with the \"Know, Feel, Do\" framework, ensuring a holistic educational experience.1\n(4:24) Users Know the explicit learning objectives: the definitions and contextual applications of hundreds of SAT-level words.1\n(4:33) Users Feel a strong sense of agency. They feel empathy for their character, curiosity about the narrative, and the profound satisfaction of overcoming difficult challenges, engaging the affective domain.1\n(4.46) And users Do things constantly. They actively construct text commands, they make critical decisions at story junctures, they apply new vocabulary to solve puzzles, and they write thoughtful, reflective responses in their journals.1\n(Slide 8: A Living Laboratory)\n(5:04) This synthesis of narrative, psychology, and a high-performance AI architecture makes the Ask Pete Initiative a fertile, pre-conceptualized \"living laboratory\".1 It is a platform poised for cutting-edge research in AI-mediated learning, motivational design, and performance psychology.\n(5:21) In recognition of this potential, this project is formally proposed as a gift of all intellectual property to the Purdue Learning Design and Technology program, to serve as a platform for future student projects and faculty research.1\n(Slide 9: Conclusion)\n(5:35) Thank you for your time.\nPart III: Presentation Tools - Challenge 3: The Animated Adaptation & Process Analysis\n3.1. Animated Video Concept & Storyboard\nTool: Powtoon 2\nTopic: The \"AI as a Mirror\" Feature: Fostering Metacognition\nCharacters:\n\"Alex\": A student avatar (using Powtoon's \"Modern Edge\" style).\n\"The Guide\": An animated character representing the Socratic AI. To emphasize its non-human, non-judgmental nature, this will be a \"floating orb of light\" or a \"wise owl\" character.2\nStyle: Clean, modern, animated.\nTarget Length: 3 minutes.\n3.2. Full Submission: \"Benefits & Challenges\" Document\nAnalysis of the Animated Presentation Process\n1. Animation Tool Used\nFor this adapted presentation, I selected Powtoon.2 This decision was based on the tool's robust library of pre-built characters, props, and \"cartoon-style\" templates. These features are ideal for representing the abstract pedagogical and psychological concepts of the \"Ask Pete Initiative\" in a visually engaging, non-threatening, and accessible manner, which is difficult to achieve with standard presentation software.\n2. Key Benefits & Advantages Encountered\nPedagogical Abstraction (The \"Meta-Benefit\"): The \"AI as a Mirror\" concept 1 is pedagogically complex, abstract, and psychologically sensitive. The primary benefit of using animation was its power of abstraction. By translating a \"student\" into a simple avatar (\"Alex\") and the complex, disembodied \"Socratic AI\" into a tangible, non-threatening \"Guide\" character (the orb of light), the animation makes the entire process feel safe, simple, and understandable. It demonstrates the concept of psychological safety by being, itself, a non-threatening visual metaphor.\nFulfilling the \"Feel\" Objective: The \"Ask Pete\" project is built on the \"Know, Feel, Do\" framework.1 My standard presentation (Challenge 2) was excellent at the \"Know\" part (explaining the concepts). Animation, however, excels at the \"Feel\" part. Using Powtoon's character-based animation, I was able to visually represent and contrast emotions like boredom (with flashcards) and engagement (in the game world), which is far more impactful for an audience than a static bullet point.\nDynamic Highlighting: The badge requirement to \"highlight key information in an animated manner\" 2 proved highly beneficial. In a standard presentation, academic terms like \"Situated Learning\" or \"Psychological Safety\" are just text on a slide. In Powtoon, I could have these terms \"pop\" onto the screen with sound effects, timed perfectly with the narration. This uses principles of multimedia learning (e.g., temporal contiguity) to reinforce the concept and draw the viewer's attention to the key takeaways.\n3. Challenges Encountered\nBalancing Simplicity and Nuance: The primary challenge was balancing the pedagogical nuance of the \"Ask Pete\" project with the inherent simplicity of a drag-and-drop animation tool like Powtoon. The tool is not designed for deep, academic discourse. The risk was \"dumbing down\" the concept or making it feel trivial. I had to constantly fight the urge to add more explanatory text, and instead trust the combination of simple visuals and precise, concise narration to carry the complex meaning.\nThe \"Character\" Constraint: The badge requires an \"animated character\" to present information.2 This was a conceptual challenge for representing an AI. I chose a \"floating orb\" to represent the Guide, but finding a balance between \"non-human\" and \"expressive\" was difficult. A more human-like character would have been \"warmer\" but would have undermined the key project concept of a non-human AI guide that reduces the social judgment and \"peer\" pressure that comes from human-like interaction.1 This constraint forced a critical design decision that ultimately strengthened the video's conceptual integrity.\nThe \"3-6 Minute\" Constraint & Production Time: My original presentation script was nearly 6 minutes. The animation process is significantly more time-consuming per-second-of-content than creating a slide. I had to ruthlessly edit my script down to a 3-minute core, focusing only on the \"AI as a Mirror\" feature.1 This was a challenge of \"killing your darlings,\" but it resulted in a more focused, high-impact instructional video that respects the viewer's time and attention span.\n4.

Instead, Ask Pete employs Carl Jung's archetypes—The Hero, The Mentor, The Shadow, The Trickster.1\n(2:20) As seen in this mockup, a user builds their character by defining their personality along a scale for each archetype.1 This isn't just a novel game mechanic; it's a bridge to pedagogy. It provides the user with a rich vocabulary for understanding human motivation and behavior. This identity framework then becomes the foundation for the platform's core innovation.1\n(Slide 5: AI as a Mirror)\n(2:45) That core innovation is a feature I call \"AI as a Mirror\".1 This system is engineered to move beyond simple content delivery and foster deep, metacognitive reflection.\n(3:00) At the conclusion of major story arcs, the platform triggers a special \"Reflection Quest\".1 During these sequences, the AI's persona visibly shifts. It changes from a neutral \"Narrator\" that tells the story, into a Socratic \"Contemplative Guide\" that facilitates reflection.1\n(3:18) This Guide then prompts the user with personalized questions designed to encourage self-analysis of their in-game choices, connecting those decisions back to their real-world values and their chosen character archetypes.1\n(Slide 6: Psychological Safety)\n(3:33) For instance, the Guide might ask, \"Your character, who embodies the Caregiver archetype, chose to sacrifice the artifact to save the villager. How does that reflect your own values when faced with a choice between personal gain and helping others?\".1\n(3:50) Critically, this feature is engineered to create a space of high psychological safety.1 The one-on-one, private interaction with a non-human, non-judgmental AI guide creates an environment where students can be vulnerable. It allows them to explore their own motivations, ethical dilemmas, and mistakes without the fear of peer scrutiny that so often stifles authentic reflection in a group setting.1\n(Slide 7: Know, Feel, Do)\n(4:17) This entire experience is consciously designed to align with the \"Know, Feel, Do\" framework, ensuring a holistic educational experience.1\n(4:24) Users Know the explicit learning objectives: the definitions and contextual applications of hundreds of SAT-level words.1\n(4:33) Users Feel a strong sense of agency. They feel empathy for their character, curiosity about the narrative, and the profound satisfaction of overcoming difficult challenges, engaging the affective domain.1\n(4.46) And users Do things constantly. They actively construct text commands, they make critical decisions at story junctures, they apply new vocabulary to solve puzzles, and they write thoughtful, reflective responses in their journals.1\n(Slide 8: A Living Laboratory)\n(5:04) This synthesis of narrative, psychology, and a high-performance AI architecture makes the Ask Pete Initiative a fertile, pre-conceptualized \"living laboratory\".1 It is a platform poised for cutting-edge research in AI-mediated learning, motivational design, and performance psychology.\n(5:21) In recognition of this potential, this project is formally proposed as a gift of all intellectual property to the Purdue Learning Design and Technology program, to serve as a platform for future student projects and faculty research.1\n(Slide 9: Conclusion)\n(5:35) Thank you for your time.\nPart III: Presentation Tools - Challenge 3: The Animated Adaptation & Process Analysis\n3.1. Animated Video Concept & Storyboard\nTool: Powtoon 2\nTopic: The \"AI as a Mirror\" Feature: Fostering Metacognition\nCharacters:\n\"Alex\": A student avatar (using Powtoon's \"Modern Edge\" style).\n\"The Guide\": An animated character representing the Socratic AI. To emphasize its non-human, non-judgmental nature, this will be a \"floating orb of light\" or a \"wise owl\" character.2\nStyle: Clean, modern, animated.\nTarget Length: 3 minutes.\n3.2. Full Submission: \"Benefits & Challenges\" Document\nAnalysis of the Animated Presentation Process\n1. Animation Tool Used\nFor this adapted presentation, I selected Powtoon.2 This decision was based on the tool's robust library of pre-built characters, props, and \"cartoon-style\" templates. These features are ideal for representing the abstract pedagogical and psychological concepts of the \"Ask Pete Initiative\" in a visually engaging, non-threatening, and accessible manner, which is difficult to achieve with standard presentation software.\n2. Key Benefits & Advantages Encountered\nPedagogical Abstraction (The \"Meta-Benefit\"): The \"AI as a Mirror\" concept 1 is pedagogically complex, abstract, and psychologically sensitive. The primary benefit of using animation was its power of abstraction. By translating a \"student\" into a simple avatar (\"Alex\") and the complex, disembodied \"Socratic AI\" into a tangible, non-threatening \"Guide\" character (the orb of light), the animation makes the entire process feel safe, simple, and understandable. It demonstrates the concept of psychological safety by being, itself, a non-threatening visual metaphor.\nFulfilling the \"Feel\" Objective: The \"Ask Pete\" project is built on the \"Know, Feel, Do\" framework.1 My standard presentation (Challenge 2) was excellent at the \"Know\" part (explaining the concepts). Animation, however, excels at the \"Feel\" part. Using Powtoon's character-based animation, I was able to visually represent and contrast emotions like boredom (with flashcards) and engagement (in the game world), which is far more impactful for an audience than a static bullet point.\nDynamic Highlighting: The badge requirement to \"highlight key information in an animated manner\" 2 proved highly beneficial. In a standard presentation, academic terms like \"Situated Learning\" or \"Psychological Safety\" are just text on a slide. In Powtoon, I could have these terms \"pop\" onto the screen with sound effects, timed perfectly with the narration. This uses principles of multimedia learning (e.g., temporal contiguity) to reinforce the concept and draw the viewer's attention to the key takeaways.\n3. Challenges Encountered\nBalancing Simplicity and Nuance: The primary challenge was balancing the pedagogical nuance of the \"Ask Pete\" project with the inherent simplicity of a drag-and-drop animation tool like Powtoon. The tool is not designed for deep, academic discourse. The risk was \"dumbing down\" the concept or making it feel trivial. I had to constantly fight the urge to add more explanatory text, and instead trust the combination of simple visuals and precise, concise narration to carry the complex meaning.\nThe \"Character\" Constraint: The badge requires an \"animated character\" to present information.2 This was a conceptual challenge for representing an AI. I chose a \"floating orb\" to represent the Guide, but finding a balance between \"non-human\" and \"expressive\" was difficult. A more human-like character would have been \"warmer\" but would have undermined the key project concept of a non-human AI guide that reduces the social judgment and \"peer\" pressure that comes from human-like interaction.1 This constraint forced a critical design decision that ultimately strengthened the video's conceptual integrity.\nThe \"3-6 Minute\" Constraint & Production Time: My original presentation script was nearly 6 minutes. The animation process is significantly more time-consuming per-second-of-content than creating a slide. I had to ruthlessly edit my script down to a 3-minute core, focusing only on the \"AI as a Mirror\" feature.1 This was a challenge of \"killing your darlings,\" but it resulted in a more focused, high-impact instructional video that respects the viewer's time and attention span.\n4.
